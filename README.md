### Hi there, I'm Pavel 👋

I'm an independent systems architect and researcher, exploring the frontier of AI capabilities. My work sits at the intersection of software engineering and cognitive science, focused on a single question: **What foundational infrastructure do we need to build truly coherent and reliable AI partners?**

My research has shown me that the biggest bottlenecks aren't always in the models themselves, but in the systems we build around them. My current work is focused on solving two of these fundamental problems: **amnesia** and **unreliability**.

### 🔬 My Core Research & Projects

I believe in building small, powerful, open-source tools that solve one problem exceptionally well.

*   🔥 **[Phoenix-Parser](https://github.com/shalyhinpavel/phoenix)**: A resilient, cascade-based parser to rescue structured data from messy LLM outputs. *Because reliable communication is the bedrock of any complex system.*
    *   **[Try the Live Demo 🚀](https://huggingface.co/spaces/shalyhinpavel/phoenix)** | **[Read the Research Note 📝](https://gist.github.com/shalyhinpavel/b30465c1eb0e453c7135dd8827fd66a1)**

*   🧠 **[Mycelium](https://github.com/shalyhinpavel/mycelium)**: A cognitive memory architecture that gives LLMs long-term context and prevents "amnesia" in extended dialogues. *Because an AI that can't remember is not a partner, it's just a tool.*

### 💬 Let's Talk About

I'm always open to discussing and collaborating on:

*   Architecting stateful, long-running AI systems.
*   Reliable data-flow in multi-agent architectures.
*   Bridging the gap between creative LLM output and deterministic code.
*   The concept of "High-Energy Cognitive States" in language models.
